Skylands is a Minecraft mod/plugin for fabric loader. Simple skyblock islands generator and manager allowing your server's players create and visit islands.
Skylands provides its own island template so you don't have to worry about creating it. On the other hand, the hub, shops, and other stuffs should be arranged by server developers. This mod is not complete and still in active development.
